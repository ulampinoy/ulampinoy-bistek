We're back in the kitchen for the 3rd Season of UlamPinoy! For our first episode we are cooking a very popular Filipino vegetable stir-fry recipe – Chopsuey.

Fast and easy to cook. Fire up the wok, brown the pork belly until golden and crispy. Mix in the chicken livers. Sauté garlic and onions with the pork and livers.

Throw in vegetables that you may have already in your fridge (we had broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, green beans, red and green bell peppers, celery and cabbage). The more the merrier and colorful. Button mushrooms, zucchine, fish balls, chayote are great too for this dish. You decide what vegetables to add and the proportions of each.

Add the oyster sauce, salt and black pepper to taste. Use 2 big wooden spoons or laddles to easily toss the vegetables. Meanwhile, dissolve cornstarch in cold water. Pour the mixture and toss it some more.

Turn off heat and plate it right away to prevent over-cooking the vegetables.
