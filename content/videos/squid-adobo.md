Fresh squids cooked adobo style! We love it very much and it really shows â€“ this is the second video of Adobong Pusit

![Wash and drain the squids thoroughly](/images/fresh-squids.jpg)

Preserve the ink duct if you buy the squid fresh or you can always use squid/cuttlefish ink sold in packets. Most supermarkets here in Madrid sell "tinta de sepia/calamar"

Cook the squid at high heat in less time until it gets tender and add the vinegar for last. Over cooking makes it rubbery.

Squid adobo is great as a rice topping or with a glass of beer or white wine. Just be conscious when you smile while you eat (or never mind if everybody is having it)!
